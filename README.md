As this is currently, not finalized please expect breaking changes. A much better in depth guide will come in the near future.

1. Install Deno https://deno.land
2. Install Ngrok https://ngrok.com
3. Follow instructions to get ngrok running https://dashboard.ngrok.com/get-started/setup
4. Go to discord.dev login and open the bot dashboard
5. Get your public key and paste it a configs.ts file. There is an `configs.example.ts` file you can rename.
6. INVITE YOUR BOT USING THE `applications.commands` scope first before you do the next step.
7. `deno run -A -q mod.ts`
8. Type `/ping` in your server to test.
9. Enjoy!
